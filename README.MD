# Sound Mixer

This is a small program to create soundscapes and custom sound environments with your own sound files.
I use it for music and ambience during my RPG sessions, but it could be used for other purposes.

## Dependencies

[Unosquare's FFME](https://github.com/unosquare/ffmediaelement) for the Media Elements, which in turn uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for media processing.
I also use [canton7's Stylet](https://github.com/canton7/Stylet) as the MVVM framework, with [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) for JSON processing.
